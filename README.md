# Space Invaders
by; Moein Ghorbanali, Arina Shahbazi, Oguzhan Ersoy

This is a Simple Space Invaders game using Vanilla Js :)

We use Vscode and liveserver to play, but any JS web development enviroment that can run a local server would be fine.

## Running the Game Using Live Server in VSCode, used the addon default instructions and added our notes to make it easier

Step by step instructions in VSCode(in any OS, our team has 1 Windows user, 1 Mac user and 1 Linux user :)
1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. If you haven't installed the Live Server extension, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for `Live Server` by Ritwick Dey, and install it.

3. Open the workspace or folder containing the game files in VSCode.

4. Right-click on the `index.html` file in the Explorer view and select `Open with Live Server`. Alternatively, you can use the live server button in the status bar of VSCode(at the very bottom of the UI) while you are on any js or html file.

5. A new browser window should open displaying the game. If it doesn't, open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.

6. Enjoy the game! If you want to stop the server, you can use the button in the status bar again.
